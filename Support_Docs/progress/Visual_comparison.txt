# ThingsBoard Map: Data Sources vs Overlays

## 📊 Additional Data Sources (DEVICES/SENSORS)
**What it adds**: More moving dots, markers, routes

### Single Vehicle Setup:
```
🗺️ Map
└── 📍 HELECAR_TwizyData
    ├── Current position: 33.986160, -6.724923
    ├── Route trail (blue line)
    └── Tooltip: SOC 88%, Speed 0 km/h
```

### Multi-Vehicle Fleet Setup:
```
🗺️ Map
├── 📍 HELECAR_TwizyData (Your car - Blue)
│   └── Route: Home → Work
├── 🚌 HELECAR_BusData (Bus - Red)  
│   └── Route: Station A → Station B
└── ⚡ ChargingStations (Static - Green)
    ├── Station 1: Available
    └── Station 2: Occupied
```

## 🎨 Overlays (VISUAL LAYERS)
**What it adds**: Transparent layers over the map

### Weather + Traffic Setup:
```
🗺️ Base Map (Streets)
├── 🌧️ Weather Overlay (Rain clouds - semi-transparent)
├── 🚦 Traffic Overlay (Red/green roads)
├── 🏭 Air Quality Overlay (Color zones)
└── 📍 Your Vehicle Data (on top of all layers)
```

## 🤔 Which Should You Choose?

### For Your HELECAR Twizy:

#### ✅ Additional Data Sources - Use When:
- Adding other vehicles to track
- Adding charging stations locations  
- Adding delivery/pickup points
- Showing multiple time periods of same route
- Fleet management (multiple cars)

#### ✅ Overlays - Use When:
- Want to see weather conditions while driving
- Need traffic information overlay
- Want satellite imagery + street map hybrid
- Adding custom business zones/territories
- Environmental data (air quality, noise levels)

## 🎯 Recommendation for Your Use Case:

**START SIMPLE**: Just use your vehicle data first
```
🗺️ Route Map
└── 📊 Data Source: HELECAR_TwizyData
    ├── latitude, longitude
    ├── soc, motor_speed  
    └── timestamp
```

**EXPAND LATER**: Add overlays/sources as needed
- Traffic overlay for route optimization
- Weather overlay for trip planning  
- Charging stations as additional data source
- Other family vehicles as additional data sources
